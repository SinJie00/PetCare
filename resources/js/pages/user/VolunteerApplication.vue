    <h2>Be A Volunteer</h2>
    <p>The animals at Meefah Homeless Animals Shelter are always in need of your help! If you can afford one hour of your
      time, you could make a large difference in the life of an animal.

      Anything else you can think of? We are willing to work with you and any ideas you have! Come join our committees of
      dedicated volunteers who strive to make a difference in our community. You can choose to be the volunteer to be a
      part of our rescue team or shelter team which would help the shelter. We have a variety of activities or duties and
      we are constantly in need of volunteers.</p>
